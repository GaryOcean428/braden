# Visual Website Customization - Progress Tracking

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Phase)
- [x] Create initial documentation (roadmap, architecture, etc.)
- [x] Set up Site Editor page with basic structure
- [x] Implement Theme Editor component
- [x] Create placeholder for Layout Editor component
- [x] Create placeholder for Component Library
- [x] Enhance Media Library management
- [x] Define database schema for storing site customization data
- [ ] Implement site settings storage and retrieval
- [ ] Connect Theme Editor to Supabase for persistence

## Next Steps:
1. Run SQL migrations to set up necessary tables
2. Implement proper error handling for media uploads
3. Add functionality to apply theme changes to the live site
4. Create context provider for editor state management
5. Implement preview functionality

## Known Issues:
- SQL migrations need to be executed
- Theme settings are not yet applied to the website
- Type definitions need to be improved for better type safety
- Need to implement proper authentication checks across the admin interface

## Phase 2 Planning:
- Define component data schema for layout editor
- Research drag-and-drop libraries for React
- Create proof-of-concept for serializable layout configurations
- Design component property editors

## Notes:
- Consider using React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop
- Look into Monaco Editor for custom CSS/HTML editing in Phase 2
- Consider implementing undo/redo functionality using a command pattern
