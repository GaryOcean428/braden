# Visual Website Customization - Progress Tracking

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

- [x] Create initial documentation (roadmap, architecture, etc.)
- [x] Set up Site Editor page with basic structure
- [x] Implement Theme Editor component
- [x] Create placeholder for Layout Editor component
- [x] Create placeholder for Component Library
- [x] Enhance Media Library management
- [x] Define database schema for storing site customization data
- [x] Implement site settings storage and retrieval
- [x] Connect Theme Editor to Supabase for persistence
- [x] Set up necessary database tables via SQL migrations

## Phase 2: Visual Editing (Current Phase)

- [x] Implement basic Layout Editor functionality
- [x] Enhance Component Library with more components and improved UI
- [x] Add layout templates for selection
- [x] Create basic preview of layout structure
- [ ] Implement full drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Develop component property editors
- [ ] Build visual preview system for layouts
- [ ] Add responsive design controls
- [ ] Implement layout saving and loading from database

## Next Steps:

1. Implement component placement functionality in layout sections
2. Add component property panel for customization
3. Create preview mode for viewing layouts
4. Implement layout publishing system
5. Add proper error handling for layout operations
6. Create integration between Component Library and Layout Editor

## Known Issues:

- Theme settings need to be properly applied across the entire site
- Need to implement proper authentication checks across the admin interface
- Need to add responsive design capabilities to the editors
- Need to refactor larger components into smaller, focused components

## Phase 3 Planning:

- Define version history and rollback system
- Design workflow for publishing content
- Plan advanced component customization options
- Plan performance optimizations for larger sites
- Design role-based permissions for site editing

## Notes:

- Both the Layout Editor and Component Library now have enhanced UI and basic interactions
- Next focus should be on creating the connection between these components
- Consider using react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop in the next iteration
- Need to implement "Add to Layout" functionality for components
