## 🔧 SQL Migration Applied

The migration `20250108_fix_storage_rls_policies.sql` includes:

1. **Storage Bucket Setup**: Creates `hero-images` bucket with proper policies

3. **Upload Method**: Attempts signed URL upload first, falls back to direct upload
4. **Storage**: File stored in `hero-images` bucket with unique filename
